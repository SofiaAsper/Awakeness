# Project Cleanup Summary

Actions performed:

1. Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive Unity + tooling ignores (PlasticSCM, OS junk, IDE, build artifacts) and committed.
2. Consolidated loose root-level scripts into `Assets/Scripts/Misc/` and renamed classes/files to PascalCase.
3. Refactored misc scripts for style, safety, and consistency.
4. Normalized folder casing for `Minimap`, `SaveData`, `Shop` (removed lowercase meta files to allow Unity to regenerate correct ones).
5. Added `.editorconfig` to enforce consistent formatting.
6. Staged and committed housekeeping changes.

Recommended next manual steps inside Unity Editor:
- Open the project to let Unity regenerate any missing / adjusted meta files for renamed folders.
- Verify references to moved scripts (Unity should track via meta GUID; class name changes may require reassigning components if GUID changed).
- Run play mode tests focusing on objects that used: DestroyWithTime, FpsCount, ExplodeWithTime, MeleeDamage, MeleeRotationAnim.
- Remove unused third-party packages if not needed (e.g., sample/demo folders from imported assets) after confirming they are not referenced.

Potential future cleanup (not yet executed):
- Remove redundant `.sln` files (now ignored) from disk to reduce clutter.
- Evaluate large third-party demo content in `Assets/Packages/*/Demo` and `Example` directories.
- Introduce assembly definition files (`.asmdef`) to speed up compile times by segmenting code.
- Add automated build/test scripts.
